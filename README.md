shitty mod for vrchat idk

Idk I only uploaded this so this guy could help me with the code, I'm new to C# and vrchat modding. Most of this is from late night client which i decompiled. 


Don't expect this mod to work cause its not finished and its not good.

Features:
Fly (ctrl F) [Fixed Gliding Issue]


Force jump (Ctrl J) [enable jumping on game worlds like Murder 4 or Kitchen Cooks, useful if you are in a small avatar and can't reach anything]

Bring all items (ctrl K) [in the future i will make it to respawn all items instead, useful if you are playing pool and some asshole with notorius or some other client does an item orbit.



I could not figure out how to get my corrutine for UIExpansionkit to work properly so I just used keybinds instead. [probably going to copy what ares and remod do and hook directly onto the vrchat menu itself]

Coming soon:
Respawn all pickups(for when some dick with notorius steals all the items while you are playing pool) 


Might fix the fly when I figure out how 


Might fix the noclip (it does exist in the code but does not work for some reason) 


Patch risky functions (might somehow hook onto mods like VRChatUtilityKit and force allowriskyfunctions = true since mods like third person rely on that, which is fucking stupid) 


Also note to the other mod creators who have a fucking integrity check built in on all their mods, Make a fucking developer version; I'm actually sick of seeing "I can't let you do that DAVE" Like stfu I will run the mods that I want you dont own melonloader. Making it so your mods intentnionly down work with othe specific mods just because they do things you dont like Is fucking stupid. Like I dont even know how to code properly and if I have even the smallest error in my code, vrchat wont even fucking lauch, all because of your stupid integity check. ADD AN OPTION TO TURN IT OFF OR I WILL DO IT MYSELF.





I will update the code when I get home, I made some changes but I did not add them here)
